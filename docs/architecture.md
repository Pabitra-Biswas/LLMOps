# LLMOps Advanced RAG System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the end-to-end LLMOps system for the advanced RAG application.

## Core Components

1.  **DSPy Agent**: The core of our application, built using the DSPy framework. It uses a multi-hop retrieval and generation strategy with Gemini 2.0 Flash for answering questions.

2.  **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**: The primary cloud provider for hosting all services.
    *   **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**: Hosts Kubeflow and our production application services.
    *   **Artifact Registry**: Stores our versioned Docker container images.
    *   **Cloud Storage**: Used for MLflow artifacts, Kubeflow pipeline roots, and storing data.
    *   **Vertex AI**: Provides access to the Gemini family of models and hosts our deployed model as a scalable endpoint.

3.  **Containerization (Docker)**: The FastAPI application is containerized using Docker for portability and consistent deployments across environments.

## MLOps Workflow

1.  **Development**: Experiments are conducted in Jupyter notebooks. The DSPy agent is programmed, tested, and optimized.

2.  **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**:
    *   **Source Control**: Git (e.g., GitHub).
    *   **Automation**: Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.
    *   **Process**: On every push to the main branch, the pipeline automatically:
        1.  Checks out the code.
        2.  Builds a new Docker image.
        3.  Pushes the image to Google Artifact Registry with a unique tag.
        4.  Triggers the Kubeflow deployment pipeline.

3.  **Orchestration (Kubeflow)**:
    *   A Kubeflow pipeline is defined to manage the deployment workflow.
    *   The pipeline retrieves the latest Docker image and deploys it as a Vertex AI Endpoint.
    *   Future steps could include automated evaluation, A/B testing, and model monitoring.

4.  **Experiment Tracking (MLflow)**:
    *   MLflow is used to log DSPy program parameters, metrics from optimization runs, and the compiled agent itself.
    *   This provides a centralized and versioned history of all experiments.

  advanced-rag:latest





Of course. Let's sit down and build this project. I'll walk you through my thought process and actions at every stage, from an empty folder to a deployed API.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Local Setup (The First 30 Minutes)**

This phase is all about getting my local environment ready. No fancy code yet, just the boring but essential groundwork.

#### **Step 1: Scaffolding the Project**

1.  **Open the Terminal:** The first thing I do is open my terminal.
2.  **Create the Project Directory:** I'll make the main folder and `cd` into it.
    ```bash
    mkdir llmops-advanced-rag
    cd llmops-advanced-rag
    ```
3.  **Initialize Git:** This is non-negotiable. I want to track every change right from the start.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```4.  **Set up Python Environment:** I'll create a virtual environment to isolate my project's dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5.  **Create the Directory Structure:** I'll create all the folders and empty files we defined earlier. This gives the project a clean, organized skeleton.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .circleci .github/workflows app docs notebooks pipelines/components scripts tests
    touch .circleci/config.yml .github/workflows/main.yml Jenkinsfile app/main.py app/dspy_agent.py app/requirements.txt app/Dockerfile docs/architecture.md notebooks/01_dspy_rag_development.ipynb pipelines/kubeflow_pipeline.py scripts/setup_gcp.sh scripts/run_local.sh tests/test_dspy_agent.py
    ```
6.  **Install Core Dependencies:** I'll open `app/requirements.txt`, add the initial packages (`dspy-ai`, `google-cloud-aiplatform`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pytest`), and install them.
    ```bash
    pip install -r app/requirements.txt
    ```

Now, my project is structured, version-controlled, and has a clean environment.

### **Phase 2: Core Logic Development (The Next 2-3 Hours)**

This is where the real fun begins. I'm focusing entirely on getting the RAG agent working correctly on my machine.

#### **Step 2: Building the RAG Agent in a Notebook**

1.  **Launch Jupyter:** I'll start a Jupyter Lab session to work interactively.
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
2.  **Open the Notebook:** Inside Jupyter, I'll navigate to `notebooks/01_dspy_rag_development.ipynb`.
3.  **Authenticate with GCP:** To use Gemini, I need to authenticate my local machine. I'll do this in my terminal. This command lets my local code act on my behalf in GCP.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
4.  **Iterative Development:** In the notebook, I will:
    *   Import `dspy` and `VertexAI`.
    *   Configure `dspy.settings` to point to my GCP project and the Gemini model.
    *   Define the `GenerateSearchQuery` and `GenerateAnswer` signatures. I'll think carefully about the descriptions, as they act as instructions for the LLM.
    *   Build the `AdvancedRAG` module, composing the signatures and retrieval steps.
    *   **Crucially, I'll test it with a simple question.** For example: `uncompiled_rag = AdvancedRAG()` and `prediction = uncompiled_rag(question="What are the main principles of LLMOps?")`.
5.  **Debug with DSPy History:** If the output is weird, I'll use `gemini_model.inspect_history(n=1)`. This is my secret weapon. It shows me the exact prompts DSPy generated and the raw output from Gemini, helping me see where the logic went wrong. I'll tweak my signature descriptions based on this feedback.
6.  **Refactor to Python Scripts:** Once I'm happy with the logic in the notebook, I'll transfer the finalized, clean code into `app/dspy_agent.py`. Then, I'll write the FastAPI wrapper code in `app/main.py` to serve this agent.

### **Phase 3: Packaging and Local Deployment (The Next Hour)**

My agent works. Now I need to package it so it can run anywhere.

#### **Step 3: Containerize with Docker**

1.  **Write the Dockerfile:** I'll open `app/Dockerfile` and write the instructions to build the image. I'll use a slim Python base image to keep it lightweight.
2.  **Write the Local Run Script:** I'll edit `scripts/run_local.sh` to build the Docker image and then run the container, mapping port 8080.
3.  **Build and Test Locally:** I'll run the script from my terminal:
    ```bash
    bash scripts/run_local.sh
    ```
4.  **Verify with `curl`:** With the container running, I'll open a *new terminal window* and send a test request. This is the moment of truth for my packaged app.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/predict" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"question": "What is Docker?"}'
    ```
    If I get a JSON response with an answer, I know my container works. I can now stop the running container with `Ctrl+C`.

### **Phase 4: Cloud Infrastructure Setup (The Next 30 Minutes)**

It's time to prepare the cloud environment where my application will live.

#### **Step 4: Run the GCP Setup Script**

1.  **Configure the Script:** I'll open `scripts/setup_gcp.sh` and replace the placeholder `your-gcp-project-id` with my actual GCP project ID.
2.  **Execute:** I'll run the script.
    ```bash
    bash scripts/setup_gcp.sh
    ```
3.  **Wait and Verify:** I'll grab a coffee while GKE creates the cluster. Once it's done, I'll go to the Google Cloud Console to visually confirm that the GKE cluster, Artifact Registry repository, and GCS bucket now exist.

### **Phase 5: CI/CD Automation (The Next Hour)**

I'm tired of manually building images. I'll automate this now. I'll use GitHub Actions for this example.

#### **Step 5: Set Up the GitHub Actions Pipeline**

1.  **Create GitHub Repo:** I'll go to GitHub, create a new repository, and follow the instructions to push my local `git` repository to it.
2.  **Generate and Store Secret:** This is a critical security step.
    *   In the GCP Console, I'll find the service account created by my setup script (`llmops-sa`).
    *   I'll create a JSON key for it and download the file.
    *   On GitHub, in my repository settings under "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions", I'll create a new repository secret named `GCP_SA_KEY`. I will paste the *entire content* of the downloaded JSON key file into this secret.
    *   I will then **delete the JSON file from my local machine**. Never commit secrets to Git.
3.  **Commit and Push the Workflow:** I'll fill in my project ID in `.github/workflows/main.yml`, then commit and push it.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow"
    git push origin main
    ```
4.  **Monitor the Action:** I'll immediately click on the "Actions" tab in my GitHub repository. I can watch in real-time as the workflow checks out my code, authenticates to GCP, builds the Docker image, and pushes it to my Artifact Registry. A green checkmark means success.

### **Phase 6: Deployment with Kubeflow (The Final 1-2 Hours)**

The image is in the registry. Now, I need to get it running as a scalable service.

#### **Step 6: Deploy via Kubeflow Pipeline**

1.  **Set Up Kubeflow/Vertex AI Pipelines:** I'll navigate to Vertex AI -> Pipelines in the GCP console and ensure it's set up and connected to my GKE cluster.
2.  **Compile the Pipeline:** On my local machine, I'll run the Python script to compile the pipeline definition into a JSON file.
    ```bash
    python pipelines/kubeflow_pipeline.py
    ```
    This creates `rag_deployment_pipeline.json`.
3.  **Upload and Run the Pipeline:**
    *   In the Vertex AI Pipelines UI, I'll click "Create Pipeline" and upload the `rag_deployment_pipeline.json` file.
    *   I'll then click "Create Run".
    *   The crucial part: in the run configuration, I'll be asked for the `docker_image_uri`. I'll go to my Artifact Registry in the GCP console, find the image pushed by GitHub Actions, and copy its full URI (e.g., `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/llm-apps/advanced-rag:c1a2b3d4...`). I'll paste this into the Kubeflow run parameter.
    *   I'll start the run.
4.  **Monitor the Deployment:** I can watch the Kubeflow graph. The `deploy-rag-model-to-vertex` component will run for a few minutes. Once it's green, I'll navigate to Vertex AI -> Endpoints. I should see my new `advanced-rag-endpoint` being created and, finally, active.

### **Phase 7: The Final Test (The Best 5 Minutes)**

The entire system is now wired up. Time to test the live, deployed endpoint.

#### **Step 7: Query the Live Endpoint**

1.  **Get the Endpoint ID:** In the Vertex AI Endpoint details page, I'll find the endpoint ID.
2.  **Send a `curl` Request:** I'll craft a `curl` command (or use the GCP SDK) to send a request to the live API. This is similar to the local test, but the URL and authentication are for the production endpoint.
    ```bash
    # (This is a simplified example; actual Vertex AI prediction curl is more complex)
    # The key is that I am now testing the deployed model, not localhost.
    ```
    When I get a valid JSON response from my production URL, I'll know the entire end-to-end system is working.

**What have I accomplished?** I've gone from an empty folder to a fully automated, deployed LLM application. A `git push` to my `main` branch now automatically builds a versioned, containerized application and places it in a registry, ready to be deployed by my orchestration pipeline. That is the core loop of LLMOps.



docker stop inspiring_sammet


#### **Tomorrow (When You Start Your Workday)**

1.  **Start Docker Desktop.** Wait for it to be running.

2.  **Open your terminal.**

3.  **Check the status of your containers.** This is a good habit to see what's there.
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```
    You will see your `inspiring_sammet` container in the list with a status like `Exited (137) About an hour ago`. This confirms it exists but is not running.

4.  **Restart the container.** This is the key command.
    ```bash
    # Using the name
    docker start inspiring_sammet
    ```
    This command starts the *exact same container* with all of its original settings, including the port mapping (`-p 9091:8080`).

5.  **Verify it's running.**
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    You should now see `inspiring_sammet` in the list with a status of `Up X seconds`. Your API is now live again!
