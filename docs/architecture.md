# LLMOps Advanced RAG System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the end-to-end LLMOps system for the advanced RAG application.

## Core Components

1.  **DSPy Agent**: The core of our application, built using the DSPy framework. It uses a multi-hop retrieval and generation strategy with Gemini 2.0 Flash for answering questions.

2.  **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**: The primary cloud provider for hosting all services.
    *   **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**: Hosts Kubeflow and our production application services.
    *   **Artifact Registry**: Stores our versioned Docker container images.
    *   **Cloud Storage**: Used for MLflow artifacts, Kubeflow pipeline roots, and storing data.
    *   **Vertex AI**: Provides access to the Gemini family of models and hosts our deployed model as a scalable endpoint.

3.  **Containerization (Docker)**: The FastAPI application is containerized using Docker for portability and consistent deployments across environments.

## MLOps Workflow

1.  **Development**: Experiments are conducted in Jupyter notebooks. The DSPy agent is programmed, tested, and optimized.

2.  **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**:
    *   **Source Control**: Git (e.g., GitHub).
    *   **Automation**: Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.
    *   **Process**: On every push to the main branch, the pipeline automatically:
        1.  Checks out the code.
        2.  Builds a new Docker image.
        3.  Pushes the image to Google Artifact Registry with a unique tag.
        4.  Triggers the Kubeflow deployment pipeline.

3.  **Orchestration (Kubeflow)**:
    *   A Kubeflow pipeline is defined to manage the deployment workflow.
    *   The pipeline retrieves the latest Docker image and deploys it as a Vertex AI Endpoint.
    *   Future steps could include automated evaluation, A/B testing, and model monitoring.

4.  **Experiment Tracking (MLflow)**:
    *   MLflow is used to log DSPy program parameters, metrics from optimization runs, and the compiled agent itself.
    *   This provides a centralized and versioned history of all experiments.

  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/secrets/key.json \
  -e GCP_PROJECT_ID="my-bigquery-test-466512" \
  advanced-rag:latest





Of course. Let's sit down and build this project. I'll walk you through my thought process and actions at every stage, from an empty folder to a deployed API.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Local Setup (The First 30 Minutes)**

This phase is all about getting my local environment ready. No fancy code yet, just the boring but essential groundwork.

#### **Step 1: Scaffolding the Project**

1.  **Open the Terminal:** The first thing I do is open my terminal.
2.  **Create the Project Directory:** I'll make the main folder and `cd` into it.
    ```bash
    mkdir llmops-advanced-rag
    cd llmops-advanced-rag
    ```
3.  **Initialize Git:** This is non-negotiable. I want to track every change right from the start.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```4.  **Set up Python Environment:** I'll create a virtual environment to isolate my project's dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5.  **Create the Directory Structure:** I'll create all the folders and empty files we defined earlier. This gives the project a clean, organized skeleton.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .circleci .github/workflows app docs notebooks pipelines/components scripts tests
    touch .circleci/config.yml .github/workflows/main.yml Jenkinsfile app/main.py app/dspy_agent.py app/requirements.txt app/Dockerfile docs/architecture.md notebooks/01_dspy_rag_development.ipynb pipelines/kubeflow_pipeline.py scripts/setup_gcp.sh scripts/run_local.sh tests/test_dspy_agent.py
    ```
6.  **Install Core Dependencies:** I'll open `app/requirements.txt`, add the initial packages (`dspy-ai`, `google-cloud-aiplatform`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pytest`), and install them.
    ```bash
    pip install -r app/requirements.txt
    ```

Now, my project is structured, version-controlled, and has a clean environment.

### **Phase 2: Core Logic Development (The Next 2-3 Hours)**

This is where the real fun begins. I'm focusing entirely on getting the RAG agent working correctly on my machine.

#### **Step 2: Building the RAG Agent in a Notebook**

1.  **Launch Jupyter:** I'll start a Jupyter Lab session to work interactively.
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
2.  **Open the Notebook:** Inside Jupyter, I'll navigate to `notebooks/01_dspy_rag_development.ipynb`.
3.  **Authenticate with GCP:** To use Gemini, I need to authenticate my local machine. I'll do this in my terminal. This command lets my local code act on my behalf in GCP.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
4.  **Iterative Development:** In the notebook, I will:
    *   Import `dspy` and `VertexAI`.
    *   Configure `dspy.settings` to point to my GCP project and the Gemini model.
    *   Define the `GenerateSearchQuery` and `GenerateAnswer` signatures. I'll think carefully about the descriptions, as they act as instructions for the LLM.
    *   Build the `AdvancedRAG` module, composing the signatures and retrieval steps.
    *   **Crucially, I'll test it with a simple question.** For example: `uncompiled_rag = AdvancedRAG()` and `prediction = uncompiled_rag(question="What are the main principles of LLMOps?")`.
5.  **Debug with DSPy History:** If the output is weird, I'll use `gemini_model.inspect_history(n=1)`. This is my secret weapon. It shows me the exact prompts DSPy generated and the raw output from Gemini, helping me see where the logic went wrong. I'll tweak my signature descriptions based on this feedback.
6.  **Refactor to Python Scripts:** Once I'm happy with the logic in the notebook, I'll transfer the finalized, clean code into `app/dspy_agent.py`. Then, I'll write the FastAPI wrapper code in `app/main.py` to serve this agent.

### **Phase 3: Packaging and Local Deployment (The Next Hour)**

My agent works. Now I need to package it so it can run anywhere.

#### **Step 3: Containerize with Docker**

1.  **Write the Dockerfile:** I'll open `app/Dockerfile` and write the instructions to build the image. I'll use a slim Python base image to keep it lightweight.
2.  **Write the Local Run Script:** I'll edit `scripts/run_local.sh` to build the Docker image and then run the container, mapping port 8080.
3.  **Build and Test Locally:** I'll run the script from my terminal:
    ```bash
    bash scripts/run_local.sh
    ```
4.  **Verify with `curl`:** With the container running, I'll open a *new terminal window* and send a test request. This is the moment of truth for my packaged app.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/predict" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"question": "What is Docker?"}'
    ```
    If I get a JSON response with an answer, I know my container works. I can now stop the running container with `Ctrl+C`.

### **Phase 4: Cloud Infrastructure Setup (The Next 30 Minutes)**

It's time to prepare the cloud environment where my application will live.

#### **Step 4: Run the GCP Setup Script**

1.  **Configure the Script:** I'll open `scripts/setup_gcp.sh` and replace the placeholder `your-gcp-project-id` with my actual GCP project ID.
2.  **Execute:** I'll run the script.
    ```bash
    bash scripts/setup_gcp.sh
    ```
3.  **Wait and Verify:** I'll grab a coffee while GKE creates the cluster. Once it's done, I'll go to the Google Cloud Console to visually confirm that the GKE cluster, Artifact Registry repository, and GCS bucket now exist.

### **Phase 5: CI/CD Automation (The Next Hour)**

I'm tired of manually building images. I'll automate this now. I'll use GitHub Actions for this example.

#### **Step 5: Set Up the GitHub Actions Pipeline**

1.  **Create GitHub Repo:** I'll go to GitHub, create a new repository, and follow the instructions to push my local `git` repository to it.
2.  **Generate and Store Secret:** This is a critical security step.
    *   In the GCP Console, I'll find the service account created by my setup script (`llmops-sa`).
    *   I'll create a JSON key for it and download the file.
    *   On GitHub, in my repository settings under "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions", I'll create a new repository secret named `GCP_SA_KEY`. I will paste the *entire content* of the downloaded JSON key file into this secret.
    *   I will then **delete the JSON file from my local machine**. Never commit secrets to Git.
3.  **Commit and Push the Workflow:** I'll fill in my project ID in `.github/workflows/main.yml`, then commit and push it.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow"
    git push origin main
    ```
4.  **Monitor the Action:** I'll immediately click on the "Actions" tab in my GitHub repository. I can watch in real-time as the workflow checks out my code, authenticates to GCP, builds the Docker image, and pushes it to my Artifact Registry. A green checkmark means success.

### **Phase 6: Deployment with Kubeflow (The Final 1-2 Hours)**

The image is in the registry. Now, I need to get it running as a scalable service.

#### **Step 6: Deploy via Kubeflow Pipeline**

1.  **Set Up Kubeflow/Vertex AI Pipelines:** I'll navigate to Vertex AI -> Pipelines in the GCP console and ensure it's set up and connected to my GKE cluster.
2.  **Compile the Pipeline:** On my local machine, I'll run the Python script to compile the pipeline definition into a JSON file.
    ```bash
    python pipelines/kubeflow_pipeline.py
    ```
    This creates `rag_deployment_pipeline.json`.
3.  **Upload and Run the Pipeline:**
    *   In the Vertex AI Pipelines UI, I'll click "Create Pipeline" and upload the `rag_deployment_pipeline.json` file.
    *   I'll then click "Create Run".
    *   The crucial part: in the run configuration, I'll be asked for the `docker_image_uri`. I'll go to my Artifact Registry in the GCP console, find the image pushed by GitHub Actions, and copy its full URI (e.g., `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/llm-apps/advanced-rag:c1a2b3d4...`). I'll paste this into the Kubeflow run parameter.
    *   I'll start the run.
4.  **Monitor the Deployment:** I can watch the Kubeflow graph. The `deploy-rag-model-to-vertex` component will run for a few minutes. Once it's green, I'll navigate to Vertex AI -> Endpoints. I should see my new `advanced-rag-endpoint` being created and, finally, active.

### **Phase 7: The Final Test (The Best 5 Minutes)**

The entire system is now wired up. Time to test the live, deployed endpoint.

#### **Step 7: Query the Live Endpoint**

1.  **Get the Endpoint ID:** In the Vertex AI Endpoint details page, I'll find the endpoint ID.
2.  **Send a `curl` Request:** I'll craft a `curl` command (or use the GCP SDK) to send a request to the live API. This is similar to the local test, but the URL and authentication are for the production endpoint.
    ```bash
    # (This is a simplified example; actual Vertex AI prediction curl is more complex)
    # The key is that I am now testing the deployed model, not localhost.
    ```
    When I get a valid JSON response from my production URL, I'll know the entire end-to-end system is working.

**What have I accomplished?** I've gone from an empty folder to a fully automated, deployed LLM application. A `git push` to my `main` branch now automatically builds a versioned, containerized application and places it in a registry, ready to be deployed by my orchestration pipeline. That is the core loop of LLMOps.



docker stop inspiring_sammet


#### **Tomorrow (When You Start Your Workday)**

1.  **Start Docker Desktop.** Wait for it to be running.

2.  **Open your terminal.**

3.  **Check the status of your containers.** This is a good habit to see what's there.
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```
    You will see your `inspiring_sammet` container in the list with a status like `Exited (137) About an hour ago`. This confirms it exists but is not running.

4.  **Restart the container.** This is the key command.
    ```bash
    # Using the name
    docker start inspiring_sammet
    ```
    This command starts the *exact same container* with all of its original settings, including the port mapping (`-p 9091:8080`).

5.  **Verify it's running.**
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    You should now see `inspiring_sammet` in the list with a status of `Up X seconds`. Your API is now live again!

2. Upload to Vertex AI Pipelines:

Go to the Kubeflow UI you showed earlier
Select "Upload a new pipeline or component"
Name: advanced-rag-pipeline
File: Select rag_deployment_pipeline.json
Click Upload

3. Create Run:
When creating the run, use this as your docker_image_uri parameter:
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-bigquery-test-466512/llm-apps/advanced-rag:latest
Recommendation: Use the latest tag for easier maintenance, or use the specific SHA if you want to pin to this exact version.

Have you generated the rag_deployment_pipeline.json file yet? If you're getting any errors running the Python script, let me know!RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.




Of course. Here are the step-by-step instructions to create a new repository for your Vertex AI Pipelines.

A repository in this context is a place within Google's Artifact Registry that stores your compiled pipeline templates (.json or .yaml files).

Steps to Create a Vertex AI Pipeline Repository
Navigate to Vertex AI Pipelines:

In the Google Cloud Console, go to the navigation menu (☰).

Select Vertex AI.

In the Vertex AI menu, find the "Deploy and use" section and click on Pipelines.

Go to the Templates Tab:

On the Pipelines page, click on the "Your templates" tab. This is where you manage your pipeline definitions.

Start the Upload Process:

Click the + Upload button at the top of the page. This will open a new pane on the right side.

Create the New Repository:

In the "Upload pipeline" pane, look for the "Repository" dropdown menu.

Click on the dropdown menu. At the bottom of the list, you will see an option to Create new repository. Click it.

Configure the Repository:

A "Create repository" dialog box will appear.

Name: Enter a unique name for your repository (e.g., my-project-pipelines-repo).

Format: This will be automatically set to KFP (Kubeflow Pipelines), which is correct.

Location Type: Select Region and then choose the desired region (e.g., us-central1).

Click Create.

Finish:

The system will create the repository in Artifact Registry for you.

You will be returned to the "Upload pipeline" pane, and your newly created repository will now be selected in the dropdown. You can now proceed to upload your pipeline template file.

### Solution: How to Deploy with Apache Airflow

Here is a complete, step-by-step guide to replacing your Kubeflow pipeline with an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

#### Step 1: Prerequisites

1.  **Running Airflow Instance:** You need an Airflow environment. Based on your `docker ps` output, it looks like you already have one running locally with Docker Compose.
2.  **Install Google Provider:** Make sure your Airflow environment has the necessary Google provider package installed. You would typically add this to the `requirements.txt` file for your Airflow Docker image and rebuild it.
    ```
    apache-airflow-providers-google
    ```
3.  **Set Up GCP Connection:** In the Airflow UI, you need to create a connection to your Google Cloud project.
    *   Go to **Admin -> Connections**.
    *   Click **"Add a new record"**.
    *   Set the **Connection type** to **"Google Cloud"**.
    *   Give it a **Connection Id**, for example, `google_cloud_default`.
    *   Provide your authentication details. The easiest way is to paste the entire contents of your `gcp-key.json` service account file into the **"Keyfile JSON"** field.
    *   Save the connection.

#### Step 2: Create the Airflow DAG File

Instead of `kubeflow_pipeline.py`, you will create a new DAG file (e.g., `deploy_rag_model_dag.py`) and place it in your Airflow project's `dags` folder.

Here is the code for that file:

```python
# In your Airflow project's dags/ folder
# File: deploy_rag_model_dag.py

from __future__ import annotations

import pendulum

from airflow.models.dag import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator

# The GCP connection ID you created in the Airflow UI
GCP_CONN_ID = "google_cloud_default"
# Your GCP Project ID
GCP_PROJECT_ID = "my-bigquery-test-466512"
# The region where you want to deploy the model
GCP_REGION = "us-central1" # Or "us-east1", etc.

def deploy_model_to_vertex_ai(project_id: str, region: str, **context):
    """
    A Python function that uses the Vertex AI SDK to deploy a model.
    This is the core logic of our deployment task.
    """
    from google.cloud import aiplatform

    # Retrieve the Docker image URI passed from the trigger command
    docker_image_uri = context["dag_run"].conf.get("docker_image_uri")
    if not docker_image_uri:
        raise ValueError("'docker_image_uri' must be provided in the DAG run configuration.")

    print(f"Starting deployment for image: {docker_image_uri}")

    # 1. Initialize the Vertex AI client
    aiplatform.init(project=project_id, location=region)

    model_display_name = "advanced-rag-agent-airflow"
    endpoint_display_name = f"{model_display_name}-endpoint"

    # 2. Upload the model to Vertex AI Model Registry
    print(f"Uploading model '{model_display_name}'...")
    model = aiplatform.Model.upload(
        display_name=model_display_name,
        serving_container_image_uri=docker_image_uri,
        serving_container_predict_route="/predict",
        serving_container_health_route="/health",
        serving_container_ports=[8080],
    )
    print(f"Model uploaded successfully: {model.resource_name}")

    # 3. Create a new endpoint
    print(f"Creating endpoint '{endpoint_display_name}'...")
    endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint.create(display_name=endpoint_display_name)
    print(f"Endpoint created successfully: {endpoint.resource_name}")

    # 4. Deploy the model to the endpoint
    print("Deploying model to endpoint...")
    endpoint.deploy(
        model=model,
        machine_type="n1-standard-4", # You can choose your machine type here
        min_replica_count=1,
        max_replica_count=1,
        traffic_split={"0": 100},
        sync=True, # Waits for the deployment to complete
    )
    print("Model deployed successfully!")


with DAG(
    dag_id="vertex_ai_rag_model_deployment",
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2025, 1, 1, tz="UTC"),
    catchup=False,
    schedule=None, # This DAG is meant to be triggered manually
    tags=["mlops", "rag", "vertex-ai"],
) as dag:
    deploy_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id="deploy_rag_model_to_vertex",
        python_callable=deploy_model_to_vertex_ai,
        op_kwargs={"project_id": GCP_PROJECT_ID, "region": GCP_REGION},
        # Ensure this task uses the GCP connection you configured
        gcp_conn_id=GCP_CONN_ID,
    )

```

#### Step 3: Trigger the DAG Manually

1.  **Push your Docker Image:** Your GitHub Actions pipeline will build your Docker image and push it to Artifact Registry. Copy the full URI of the image (e.g., `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/.../advanced-rag:c1a2b3d4...`).
2.  **Go to the Airflow UI:** Open your Airflow webserver (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
3.  **Find and Unpause the DAG:** Find the DAG named `vertex_ai_rag_model_deployment` and un-pause it.
4.  **Trigger the DAG:** Click the "Play" button (▶️) on the right side of the DAG's row.
5.  **Provide the Docker URI:** A menu will pop up. Select **"Trigger DAG w/ config"**. In the JSON box that appears, you must provide the Docker image URI like this:
    ```json
    {
      "docker_image_uri": "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-bigquery-test-466512/llm-apps/advanced-rag:c1a2b3d4e5f6"
    }
    ```
6.  **Click Trigger:** The DAG run will start. You can click on its name to see the progress and view the logs for the `deploy_rag_model_to_vertex` task in real-time.

This Airflow DAG achieves the exact same outcome as your Kubeflow pipeline but in a way that is far less likely to hit your specific quota limit.



### **Step 2: Re-build and Re-push Your RAG Model Image**

Now that you've fixed the core application, you need to publish a new version of it.

1.  **Open your terminal** in the `llmops-advanced-rag` root directory.
2.  **Get the new Git commit hash** to use as a unique version tag.
    ```bash
    git rev-parse --short HEAD
    ```
    (Let's say the output is `e4f5g6h`)
3.  **Build the RAG model image** (this is different from the proxy image).
    ```bash
    docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-bigquery-test-466512/llm-apps/advanced-rag:e140edb -f app/Dockerfile .
    ```
4.  **Push the new RAG model image:**
    ```bash
    docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-bigquery-test-466512/llm-apps/advanced-rag:e140edb
    ```

### **Step 3: Re-deploy the Endpoint with Airflow**

Finally, tell Vertex AI to use this new, corrected version of your model.

1.  **Go to your Airflow UI** (`http://localhost:8080`).
2.  **Trigger the `vertex_ai_rag_model_deployment` DAG again.**
3.  **CRITICAL:** In the configuration JSON, use the **new image URI with the new tag**.
    ```json
    {
      "docker_image_uri": "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-bigquery-test-466512/llm-apps/advanced-rag:e140edb"
    }
    ```
4.  **Wait for the Airflow DAG to finish.** This will take time, as it has to create a new model version and deploy it to the endpoint. It will perform a "blue-green" deployment, safely replacing the old broken version with the new working one without any downtime.

### **Final Step: Test the Webpage Again**

Once the Airflow DAG has successfully finished, go back to your public Cloud Run URL. **You do not need to redeploy the proxy again.** The proxy is already correct.

Now, when you ask a question on the webpage, the entire chain will work:
*   **Frontend** sends `{"question": ...}` to the Proxy.
*   **Proxy** receives it and calls Vertex AI with `{"instances": [{"question": ...}]}`.
*   **Vertex AI Endpoint** receives this, and your **newly deployed RAG model** now understands this format, processes the question, and returns the answer correctly.
*   The **Proxy** gets the answer and sends it back to the **Frontend**.
*   The **Frontend** displays the correct answer.

#### Step 2: Re-build, Re-push, and Re-deploy

You need to repeat the deployment process one last time with this fix.

1.  **Build a new image version (v3):**
    ```bash
    docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-bigquery-test-466512/llm-apps/rag-web-proxy:v3 -f web-proxy/Dockerfile .
    ```

2.  **Push the new image:**
    ```bash
    docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-bigquery-test-466512/llm-apps/rag-web-proxy:v3
    ```

3.  **Deploy the new image:** Run the single-line command.
    ```shell
    gcloud run deploy rag-web-proxy --image="us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-bigquery-test-466512/llm-apps/rag-web-proxy:v3" --platform="managed" --region="us-central1" --allow-unauthenticated --service-account="rag-web-proxy-sa@my-bigquery-test-466512.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    ```

This time, the container will start, Uvicorn will listen on the correct port `8080`, the health check will pass, and your service will become available. This should be the final fix.

### **Project Title: End-to-End LLMOps System for an Advanced RAG-Based Q&A Application on GCP**

#### **Project Summary:**
Designed, built, and deployed a complete, production-grade LLMOps system to serve an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The project automates the entire lifecycle of an AI application, from development and containerization to CI/CD, orchestrated deployment, and a user-facing web interface, all hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

---

#### **Key Achievements & Responsibilities:**

*   **Advanced RAG Model Development:**
    *   Engineered a sophisticated multi-hop RAG agent using the **DSPy** framework to programmatically build and optimize the prompt pipeline.
    *   Leveraged **Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash** model via Vertex AI for efficient and powerful language generation, enabling the agent to reason over retrieved context and generate comprehensive answers.

*   **End-to-End MLOps Automation:**
    *   Established a robust CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **CircleCI** to automate testing, containerization, and artifact versioning. On every push to the `main` branch, unit tests are executed with **Pytest**, and a versioned Docker image is built and pushed to **Google Artifact Registry**.
    *   Orchestrated the deployment process using **Apache Airflow**, creating a DAG that automatically deploys the latest model version to a **Vertex AI Endpoint**. This approach was chosen to bypass initial free-tier quota limitations encountered with Kubeflow.

*   **Cloud-Native Infrastructure & Deployment:**
    *   Containerized the core RAG model (FastAPI application) and a secure web proxy using **Docker** for portability and consistent deployments.
    *   Deployed a stylish, user-friendly frontend (`HTML/CSS/JS`) and a secure backend proxy (FastAPI) as a public-facing web application on **Google Cloud Run**.
    *   Secured the entire architecture by implementing IAM best practices, using dedicated **Service Accounts** to manage permissions between Cloud Run, Vertex AI Endpoints, and the foundational Gemini models.

*   **System Architecture & Tech Stack:**
    *   **AI/ML:** `DSPy`, `Google Gemini 2.0 Flash`, `FastAPI`
    *   **CI/CD & Automation:** `Git`, `GitHub Actions`, `CircleCI`, `Apache Airflow`
    *   **Containerization:** `Docker`
    *   **Cloud Platform:** `Google Cloud Platform (GCP)`
        *   **Serving:** `Vertex AI Endpoints`, `Cloud Run`
        *   **Compute & Orchestration:** `Compute Engine`
        *   **Storage:** `Artifact Registry`
        *   **Security:** `IAM (Service Accounts)`
